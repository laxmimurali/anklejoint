# Open source numerical model of anklejoint

A uniform layer of cartilage is extruded on the talar and tibial surface and then stitched to the existing foot and tibia mesh respectively.
The foot and tibial meshes are assembled together to use for OpenFOAM model. The TibAndFoot has the final meshes assembled together.
